# Security
The purpose of project Fenrir is to develop a security system capable of monitoring both RFID access and security camera footage via secure web access from a portal specifically secured and catered for the user using a password authenticated system.

This project is directed towards two specific demographics, first for those who already have older generation CCTV Cameras with analog/BNC output installed. 
Second, for those who do not have any cameras or security installed in their home, office, or complex.


This project will be made with the purpose of reconfiguring a poorly maintained security system in a local apartment complex.
There are some cameras that are inactive in the elevators, as well as no communication to the front door/elevators for residents to communicate or allow guests into their home.
Each elevator, parking garage, and staircases are secured with an RFID system using key FOBs/proximity cards. 
There is a communication system at the front door, but out of service.

The solution:
Integrate the camera systems and intercom to a single source. Since the building uses fiber optic internet options, find a way to integrate using WiFi/IoT for highest potential communication speeds.

Communication must be processed in multiple potential facets:

First, we would need a Central system for entry logging for all residents that come in, which they likely already have.
Distributed system for anything involving WiFi communications (such as video feed).

This would mean data distribution depending on multiple locations of internet connectivity. This also means having universal WiFi in the building.
